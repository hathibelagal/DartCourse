# [Getting Started With Dart][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

The Dart programming language, initially developed by Google, is an easier and cleaner alternative to JavaScript. That's probably why it's one of the fastest growing languages today. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal shows you how to build web apps with Dart. This course covers not only the basics of the language, but also advanced features such as object-oriented and asynchronous programming. Furthermore, because, most web developers who use Dart tend to use it with the Angular framework, this course also introduces you to Angular Dart 2.2.0. Throughout the course, you will be using IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE.
